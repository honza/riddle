Riddle - Sphinx theme
=====================

Riddle is a simple theme for Sphinx that focuses on readability and removes a
lot of the usual fluff.  It also gives you a fixed-width layout which is easier
on the eyes.

*This is a work in progress*

The name is inspired by the mythical Sphinx who asked travellers a riddle to
allow them passage.
